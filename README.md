How to use the app:

1) Put a txt file named "accounts.txt" with all the accounts where you would like to change the password in correct form (as shown in the example accounts.txt file) in folder "acc_data"
2) Run cmd as administrator, change the directory on the command line to the folder where the application is located.
3) Run the command "npm start"

The application will change all passwords of the listed accounts to randomly generated passwordsa and put the updated accounts in the same txt file.

Correct format of accounts in the txt:
<email address>;<random symbols>;<password>
